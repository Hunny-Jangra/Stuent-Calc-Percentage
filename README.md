In order to find the percentage of the marks, we divide the total scores with marks obtained in the examination and then multiply the result with 100.

Add up all the marks of the six semesters and then divide that by the total marks. You will get the average. For example if the total marks is 1000 and you got a total of 750 then your percentage is 750/1000*100=75%.
